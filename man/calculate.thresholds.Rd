\title{Calculate the thresholds associated with a given truncation rule and given facies proportions when the number of GRFs are independent.}
\usage{
calculate.thresholds(flag, nthres, proportions, ymin, ymax)
}
\arguments{
\item{flag}{A vector with category numbers codifying the truncation rule.}

\item{nthres}{A vector with the number of thresholds for each GRF (1 x nfield).}

\item{proportions}{A vector with the proportions for each facies.}

\item{ymin}{A value representing negative infinity (-Inf). The 'ymin' value is updated recursively when the function is used iteratively.}

\item{ymax}{A value representing positive infinity (Inf). The 'ymax' value is updated recursively when the function is used iteratively.}
}
\value{
A vector with the calculated thresholds.
}
\description{
Calculate Thresholds for Truncation Rule and Facies Proportions
}
\details{
Use calculate_thresholds(flag, nthres, proportions) and do not define the arguments 'ymin' and 'ymax', which are used recursively.
}
\examples{
# Example usage
calculate.thresholds(flag = c(2,1,3,2,1,5,2,4,4), nthres = c(2,2), 
proportions = c(0.426, 0.253, 0.047, 0.205, 0.069))
